# data_driven_ODE_discovery
This project investigates data-driven discovery of governing ordinary differential equations from time-series data, with a focus on interpretability and robustness to noise. Rather than learning black-box predictors, the objective is to recover compact and physically meaningful equations that describe the underlying dynamics of nonlinear systems.
